## v0.97.12 - 9 May 2024

### Improvements üõ†Ô∏è
* In our `init` and `sync` commands, we now show total progress for all Snaplet AI jobs (we previously were only able to show progress some kinds of Snaplet AI jobs). We can pick up when the jobs have started sooner and let you opt to skip waiting for all jobs rather than only some of them. This way you have a more complete picture of what has happened, and have more control from start to end.
