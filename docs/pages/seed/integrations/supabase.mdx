For seeding data into your Supabase project, we recommend selecting `public` and `auth` schemas only.

## Generate data for your Supabase local development stack

Supabase makes it easy to set up a local development environment linked to your Supabase project.
Seed can improve your local development by seeding your local database with data, making coding and testing more efficient and accurate.

In this short guide we'll focus on how to integate `@snaplet/seed` with your Supabase project.

## 1. Setup your supabase project

Once you have a working supabase project with a [local development stack](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development) setup.

Running `npx supabase start` should spin up the database and give you the URL to access postgres database.

```
Started supabase local development setup.

          ...
          DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgresql
          ...
```

Make sure that you have the migrations applied in your local database with your differents app tables on it.
If you don't refer to [Supabase docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development#link-your-project) to run your migrations.

## 2. Set up Seed

**2.1.** To interface with your postgres database we'll need to install an adapter for `@snaplet/seed` you can use either `node-postgres` or `postgres`

```bash
npm install -D postgres
```

**2.2.** Initialise `@snaplet/seed` in your your root project.

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx @snaplet/seed init
```

**2.3.** The init command will create a `seed.config.ts` file in which you can specify the database connection details and exclude part of the
database schema you don't want to alter with `@snaplet/seed`

```ts
import { SeedPostgres } from "@snaplet/seed/adapter-postgres";
import { defineConfig } from "@snaplet/seed/config";
import postgres from "postgres";

export default defineConfig({
  adapter: () => {
    const client = postgres("postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgresql");
    return new SeedPostgres(client);
  },
  select: [
    // We don't alter any extensions tables that might be owned by extensions
    "!*",
    // We want to alter all the tables under public schema
    "public*",
    // We also want to alter some of the tables under the auth schema
    "auth.users",
    "auth.identities",
    "auth.sessions",
  ]
});
```

Once you save the edited file, the `init` command will continue and create a `seed.ts` example file in your project folder.
You are now ready to seed your database.

## 4. Keep Seed Client in sync with your database

Whenever your database structure changes (e.g after a new migration is applied), `@snaplet/seed` will need be regenerated to reflect the new structure.
To do this, run the following command:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx @snaplet/seed sync
```

## 4. (optional) Hook into Supabase seeding workflow

You can hook into [Supabase seeding workflow](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development#add-sample-data) using the `dryRun` option for client creation in the `seed.ts` file:

```ts
import { createSeedClient } from "@snaplet/seed";

const seed = await createSeedClient({ dryRun: true });
```

This option will turn on the dry run mode, which will log the SQL queries that would be executed to the console, without actually executing them.

You can then put those queries into the sql seed script expected by supabase:

```bash
npx tsx seed.ts > supabase/seed.sql
```

Then, running `npx supabase db reset` should apply the seed script to your local database.
