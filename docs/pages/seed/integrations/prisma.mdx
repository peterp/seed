This example shows how to set up your Seed workflow with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/orm).

## Prerequisites

- Set up a new Prisma project by following the [Prisma Quickstart](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart) guide.

## 1. Install Seed

Set up Seed in your Prisma project by running the following command:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx @snaplet/seed init prisma/seed
```

This command creates a `prisma/seed` folder with multiple files in it.

## 2. Configure Seed

Using the previous command should have created a `prisma/seed/seed.config.ts` [configuration file](../reference/configuration.mdx).

You can use it as is, or customize it to fit your needs.

```ts prisma/seed/seed.config.ts
import { SeedPrisma } from "@snaplet/seed/adapter-prisma";
import { defineConfig } from "@snaplet/seed/config";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

export default defineConfig({
  adapter: () => {
    const client = new PrismaClient();
    return new SeedPrisma(client);
  },
  select: [
    "!*_prisma_migrations",
  ],
});
```

## 3. Customize the Seed Script

The `npx @snaplet/seed init prisma/seed` command should also have created a seed script example `seed.ts`.

You can customize it to seed your database with the data you need.

```ts prisma/seed/seed.ts
import { createSeedClient } from "@snaplet/seed";

const seed = await createSeedClient();

// Truncate all tables in the database
await seed.$resetDatabase();

// Seed the database with 10 users
await seed.user((x) => x(10));

process.exit();
```

## 4. Hook into Prisma seeding workflow

You can hook into [Prisma seeding workflow](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-migrate/workflows/seeding) by specifying a `seed` command in your `package.json` file:

```json package.json
"prisma": {
  "seed": "npx tsx prisma/seed/seed.ts"
},
```

With this change, the database will be seeded with the data you specified in your `seed.ts` file for each of the following commands:
- `prisma db seed`
- `prisma migrate dev`
- `prisma migrate reset`

## 5. Keep Seed Client in sync with your database

Whenever your database structure changes (e.g after a new migration is applied), `@snaplet/seed` will need be regenerated to reflect the new structure. To do this, run the following command:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx @snaplet/seed sync
```

If you want to automate this process, you can add a [post script](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/scripts#pre--post-scripts) to your `package.json` file:

```json package.json
"scripts": {
  "migrate": "prisma migrate dev",
  "postmigrate": "npx @snaplet/seed sync"
}
```
