# Configuration

Seed configuration is done in the `seed.client.ts` file.

## Config Location

The default location is `seed.client.ts` in the root of your project.

You can also specify a custom location using the [`--config`](/seed/reference/cli#common-options) flag when running the Seed CLI commands.

If you want to persist your custom location to avoid having to use `--config` for every command, you can add a `@snaplet/seed` field to your `package.json` file.

```json package.json
{
  "@snaplet/seed": {
    "config": "prisma/seed/seed.config.ts"
  }
}
```

## Config Intellisense

You can use the `defineConfig` helper to define your configuration. This will provide you with intellisense for the available options.

```ts seed.client.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@snaplet/seed/config";

export default defineConfig({
  // your configuration options here...
});
```

`defineConfig` types are generic by default, but once you [sync](./cli.mdx#sync) your Seed Client, `defineConfig` becomes typed against your database schema. ðŸª„

## Options

### adapter

- **Type:** `() => DatabaseClient<unknown> | Promise<DatabaseClient<unknown>>`
- **Required**

The database adapter to use.

**Example:**

```ts seed.client.ts
import { SeedPostgres } from "@snaplet/seed/adapter-postgres";
import { defineConfig } from "@snaplet/seed/config";
import postgres from "postgres";

export default defineConfig({
  adapter: () => {
    const client = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
    return new SeedPostgres(client);
  },
});
```

To learn more about the available adapters, see the [Adapters](./adapters.mdx) reference.

### alias.inflection

- **Type:** `boolean | InflectionStrategy`
- **Default**: `false`

Apply a global renaming strategy to all tables and columns in the generated Seed Client.

When `true`, a default strategy is applied:

- **Model names:** pluralized and camelCased.
- **Scalar field names:** camelCased.
- **Parent field names (one to one relationships):** singularized and camelCased.
- **Child field names (one to many relationships):** pluralized and camelCased.
- We also support prefix extraction and opposite baseName for foreign keys inspired by [PostGraphile](https://github.com/graphile/pg-simplify-inflector#naming-your-foreign-key-fields).

**Example:**

```ts seed.client.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@snaplet/seed/config";

export default defineConfig({
  alias: {
    inflection: true,
  },
});
```

### alias.override

- **Type:** `Record<string, { name?: string, fields?: Record<string, string> }>`

Rename specific tables and columns in the generated Seed Client.
This option is useful for resolving renaming conflicts that can arise when using `alias.inflection`.

**Example:**

```ts seed.client.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@snaplet/seed/config";

export default defineConfig({
  alias: {
    override: {
      Book: {
        name: "books",
        fields: {
          User: "author",
          published_at: "publishedAt",
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### select

- **Type:** `Array<string>`

Exclude or include tables from the generated Seed Client.
This use the [glob pattern matching api](https://globster.xyz/)

All tables are included by default, if you prefix a table with `!` everything matching that pattern will be excluded.
The patterns apply in their declaration order.

**Example:**

```ts seed.client.ts
import { defineConfig } from "@snaplet/seed/config";

export default defineConfig({
  select: [
    "!archive*",
    "!*_logs",
    "!auth.*",
    "archive.specific_table_to_include",
    "auth._prefixed_to_include*",
  ],
});
```
