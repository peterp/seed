# Installation

![Snappy installing Seed](/seed/getting-started/installation/docs-image-installation.svg)

## Automatic Installation - Setup Wizard

Run the following command in your terminal to start our handy install wizard:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx @snaplet/seed init
```

It will guide you through the installation process and help you set up your project. 

Once you've completed installation, run your Seed script with the following command:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx tsx seed.ts
```

## Manual Installation

If you prefer to do things manually, you can follow these steps.

### 1. Install the required dev dependencies

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npm install -D @snaplet/seed @snaplet/copycat
```

### 2. Configure Seed

Seed is configured using the `seed.config.ts` file.

Your need to specify an [adapter](../reference/adapters.mdx) in order for Seed to connect to your database.

For this example, we assume you are using PostgreSQL as your database and want to connect to it with the [Postgres.js](../reference/adapters.mdx#postgresjs) adapter:

```ts seed.config.ts
import { SeedPostgres } from "@snaplet/seed/adapter-postgres";
import { defineConfig } from "@snaplet/seed/config";
import postgres from "postgres";

export default defineConfig({
  adapter: () => {
    const client = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL);
    return new SeedPostgres(client);
  },
});
```

### 3. Generate your Seed Client

Now that you have configured Seed, you can generate your Seed Client by running the following command:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx @snaplet/seed sync
```

This command will introspect your database schema and generate the necessary files for your Seed Client.

### 4. Create and execute your first Seed script

Create a new `seed.ts` file.

We assume that you have a table called `users` in your database.

```ts seed.ts
import { createSeedClient } from "@snaplet/seed";

const seed = await createSeedClient();

// Truncate all tables in the database
await seed.$resetDatabase();

// Seed the database with 10 users
await seed.users((x) => x(10));

process.exit();
```

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Executing this script will delete all data in your database and seed it with 10 users. Make sure to adjust the script to your needs.
</Callout>

You can now execute your Seed script by running the following command:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx tsx seed.ts
```

Happy seeding! 🌱
