# Quick Start

![Snappy looking at the getting started guide on their laptop](/seed/getting-started/quick-start/docs-image-quick-start.svg)

## Assumptions

This guide will take you through the process of using `@snaplet/seed` to create realistic, production-like data.

## Prerequisites

You already followed the [installation guide](./installation.mdx) and have `@snaplet/seed` available locally.

## Our first Seed script

Given this PostgreSQL database schema of a blog application:

<Tabs items={["diagram", "sql"]}>
<Tab>
<TutorialSchema className="nx-mx-auto nx-my-4" />
</Tab>
<Tab>
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.user (
  id uuid NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  username text NOT NULL,
  email text NOT NULL
);
CREATE TABLE public.post (
  id uuid NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  title text NOT NULL,
  content text NOT NULL,
  author_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.user(id)
);
CREATE TABLE public.comment (
  id uuid NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  content text NOT NULL,
  author_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.user(id),
  post_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.post(id),
  written_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

Let's see how `@snaplet/seed` gives a programmatic interface to describe seeding requirements.

We need to apply this schema to a new PostgreSQL database.

Once done, we can edit the configuration file `seed.config.ts` to point to the database. We assume we already have our database client library `postgres` installed.

```ts seed.config.ts
import { SeedPostgres } from "@snaplet/seed/adapter-postgres";
import { defineConfig } from "@snaplet/seed/config";
import postgres from "postgres";

export default defineConfig({
  adapter: () => {
    const client = postgres("postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/blog");
    return new SeedPostgres(client);
  },
});
```

We can now generate our `@snaplet/seed` assets by running:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx @snaplet/seed sync
```

It's time to write our first seed script!

<CH.Scrollycoding className="seed-tutorial-seed-script">

Let's start with a bare minimum seed script.

```ts seed.ts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const seed = await createSeedClient();
```

---

For our example blog application, let's assume we need the following data:

- A post titled "Hello World!"
- A post author, with an email address that ends with "acme.org."
- Three comments on the post.

It's worth noting what we're not explicitly defining - that each comment needs to have a separate, unique author, for instance. We're assuming that `@snaplet/seed` will fill in the blanks based on the schema and seed realistic data as needed.

`seed` in the code above exposes all the models (i.e. the database tables, or the entities in our blog application - in this case "user" and "post") as functions.

These functions return what we call a _plan_. When describing a plan, we always start from a "root" model - a model where we would start describing how to seed seed data, along with data for its related models (more on this soon).

Here we start from the `posts` models. `await`ing a plan will execute it.

```ts seed.ts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const seed = await createSeedClient();

// focus
await seed.posts([{}]);
```

---

We can directly define the values of our model.

```ts seed.ts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const seed = await createSeedClient();

await seed.posts([
  {
    // focus
    title: 'Hello World!',
  },
]);
```

---

We can also define the values of our model's relationships.
Here we define the author of the post represented by the `author` field.

```ts seed.ts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

const seed = await createSeedClient();

await seed.posts([
  {
    title: 'Hello World!',
    // focus(1:6)
    author: {
      email: (ctx) =>
        copycat.email(ctx.seed, {
          domain: 'acme.org',
        }),
    },
  },
]);
```

---

Next, we also define the comments of the post represented by the `comments` field.
As we need more than one comment, we can use the `x` function which will create a list of similar comments.
We can read it as "comments times 3".

```ts seed.ts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

const seed = await createSeedClient();

await seed.posts([
  {
    title: 'Hello World!',
    author: {
      email: (ctx) =>
        copycat.email(ctx.seed, {
          domain: 'acme.org',
        }),
    },
    // focus
    comments: (x) => x(3),
  },
]);
```

---

Finally:
* We'll add a `dryRun` option when creating `SeedClient` - in dry run mode, we'll log the sql statements to the console instead of altering the database.
* and a `$resetDatabase()` call - this will clear the database of any current data, but keep the structure around

```ts seed.ts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

const seed = await createSeedClient({
  // focus
  dryRun: true
});

// focus
await seed.$resetDatabase()

await seed.posts([
  {
    title: 'Hello World!',
    author: {
      email: (ctx) =>
        copycat.email(ctx.seed, {
          domain: 'acme.org',
        }),
    },
    comments: (x) => x(3),
  },
]);
```

---

We're done!

```ts seed.ts
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed';
import { copycat } from '@snaplet/copycat';

const seed = await createSeedClient({
  dryRun: true
});

await seed.$resetDatabase()

await seed.posts([
  {
    title: 'Hello World!',
    author: {
      email: (ctx) =>
        copycat.email(ctx.seed, {
          domain: 'acme.org',
        }),
    },
    comments: (x) => x(3),
  },
]);
```

</CH.Scrollycoding>

### Executing the script

At this point, we're ready to run our seed script for the first time!

Let's see first what statements are generated by using the `dryRun: true` option.

We run this command in the terminal:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx tsx seed.ts
```

We should see the following output:

<CH.Slideshow className="seed-tutorial-sql-output">

```sql >_&nbsp;terminal
INSERT INTO public.user (email,id,username) VALUES

```

---

This is the post, titled "Hello World!" as intended.

```sql >_&nbsp;terminal focus=8

```

---

This is the author of the post, notice the "acme.org" in the email.

```sql >_&nbsp;terminal focus=2

```

---

And here are the 3 comments.

```sql >_&nbsp;terminal focus=11:13

```

---

As mentioned earlier, these 3 users were automatically generated to satisfy the requirement of 3 comments. We didn't need to define them - `@snaplet/seed` did it for us, because it knows our schema relationships and can fulfill them automatically.

```sql >_&nbsp;terminal focus=3:5

```

</CH.Slideshow>

It's now time to seed this data into our database.

In order to do that, we remove the `dryRun` option. Now, instead of logging the SQL statements to the
console, the data will be inserted into our database:

```ts seed.ts
const seed = await createSeedClient();
```

All done, we're now ready to code against our generated data!

### Evolving the application

Whenever the database structure changes, `@snaplet/seed` will need to be re-generated so that it is in sync with the new database structure.

We can do this by running:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx @snaplet/seed sync
```

This command will fetch the new structure from the database and use it to regenerate `@snaplet/seed` assets.
