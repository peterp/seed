# Migrations

## From `0.90.0` and above

### Welcome to a leaner `@snaplet/seed`

Hello, `@snaplet/seed` community! With version 0.90.0, we're excited to bring you a suite of enhancements aimed at refining and streamlining your experience.
This version introduces breaking changes, but fear not—we're here to guide you through them smoothly.

### Why the Change?

Our goal is to sharpen `@snaplet/seed`'s focus, simplifying both maintenance and your development workflows.
These changes will differentiate `@snaplet/seed` from our snapshot tool, making it more intuitive and powerful for your projects.

### What's New?

- **SQLite Support**: We're rolling out alpha support for SQLite databases, expanding your options.
- **Enhanced API Methods**: The `$resetDatabase` method now supports selective table resets, offering more control.
- **PostgreSQL Improvements**: Expect fewer bugs, especially around unique constraints during seeding.

### Key Changes to Note

1. **Seed CLI**: The `@snaplet/seed` now has its own CLI.
2. **New Configuration File**: Transition from `snaplet.config.ts` to `seed.config.ts` for a `@snaplet/seed` specific setup.
3. **Simplified Syncing**: A single `npx @snaplet/seed sync` command now replaces the previous `generate` and `introspect` commands, streamlining your workflow.

### `@snaplet/seed` now has its own CLI

If you are not using our Snapshot tool, you can uninstall the `snaplet` CLI.

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npm uninstall snaplet
```

Start your `@snaplet/seed` journey using the new onboarding wizard command:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx @snaplet/seed init
```

You can read the new [CLI reference](./reference/cli.mdx) to learn about all the available commands.

### Dive into `seed.config.ts`

#### Adapting with "adapter"

The introduction of a "database adapter" parameter in `seed.config.ts` is a significant update. Here's how you might configure the Prisma adapter:

```typescript
import { SeedPrisma } from "@snaplet/seed/adapter-prisma";
import { defineConfig } from "@snaplet/seed/config";
// You can import the prisma instance from your own code like you would
// in your backend code
import { db } from "./src/utils/db";
export default defineConfig({
  adapter: () => new SeedPrisma(db),
});
```

We've expanded our adapter offerings, including support for [Prisma, pg, postgres-js, and betterSqlite3](./reference/adapters.mdx), with more on the horizon.
Custom adapter creation is also possible, enhancing flexibility (Documentation forthcoming).

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
The new adapter change also means we don't automatically close the database connection for you.
You might now want to call `process.exit` to close the connection or your seed script may hang indefinitely.

```typescript
// at the end of seed.ts

process.exit(0);
```
</Callout>

You can read more about the new configuration by checking out the [Configuration reference](./reference/configuration.mdx).

#### Inflection is now opt-in

In response to user feedback, we've transitioned inflection to an opt-in feature, acknowledging that its default behaviour didn't align with the expectations of many within our community.
To learn more about what inflection is and what it's for you can [read the documentation here](./reference/configuration.mdx#aliasinflection).

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  // Additional configuration options
  alias: {
     // Opt-in to enable inflection behavior
     inflection: true,
  }
});
```

#### Selective Sync with "select"

The "select" option has been overhauled for greater flexibility,
adopting a [glob pattern matching](https://globster.xyz/) approach to include or exclude tables:

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
    select: [
        '!some_schema_name*', // Exclude all tables under a schema
        '!public._*', // Exclude all tables prefixed by _ in the schema public
        'public._specific_table', // include a specific table even with the prefix
    ]
});
```

All tables are included by default, if you prefix a pattern with `!` everything matching that pattern will be excluded.
The patterns apply in their declaration order.

#### Refined `$resetDatabase` Usage

Fine-tune data resets with the `$resetDatabase` [method](./reference/client.mdx#resetdatabase), allowing you to persist certain tables across seeding operations:

```typescript
import { createSeedClient } from "@snaplet/seed";
const seed = await createSeedClient();
await seed.$resetDatabase(); // Resets, respecting exclusions from config
// Example usage in tests
test('your_test', () => {...});
test('another_test', async () => {
    await seed.$resetDatabase([
        '!public.users', // Keeps user data intact
    ]);
});
```

#### `$transaction` and `$reset` methods have been removed

To get a new instance of the client, you can simply use `createSeedClient` to get a new instance.

```ts
// before
await snaplet.$transaction(async (snaplet) => {
  await snaplet.users([{}]);
});

// after
const snaplet = await createdSeedClient()
await snaplet.users([{}])
```

```ts
// before
await snaplet.users([{}]);
snaplet.$reset()

// after
let snaplet = await createdSeedClient()
await snaplet.users([{}])
snaplet = await createSeedClient()
```


### Let's Grow Together

We're excited for you to experience the improvements in `@snaplet/seed` v0.90.0.
Your feedback is invaluable to us, join the conversation on [Discord](https://app.snaplet.dev/chat) and let's make `@snaplet/seed` even better together.

## From `0.85.0` and above

**🚨 Breaking changes ahead 🚨**

We're refining the API and getting closer and closer to a stable v1 release. 🎉

### Creating a client is now async

We've changed the way in which the client is instantiated.

Previously, you would instantiate a class like this:

```ts
// before
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed'

const snaplet = new SnapletClient({ /* options */ })
```

We now instead provide a promise-returning `createSeedClient` function for instantiating the client:

```ts
// after
import { createSeedClient } from '@snaplet/seed'

const seed = await createSeedClient({ /* options */ })
```

You will also need to [update your generated assets](https://docs.snaplet.dev/core-concepts/seed#3-regenerating-assets-as-your-database-changes-with-npx-snaplet-generate):

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx snaplet generate
```

This change is due to the fact that we need to scan your database at instantiation time in order to fetch your sequences current values.

Also, you noticed that we changed our naming convention, from `snaplet` to `seed`. We think it's easier to understand this way.

### Better compatibility with non-empty databases

`@snaplet/seed` now works better with tables that already have existing data in them. For tables with sequences, if you have existing data in them when using `@snaplet/seed`,
any new rows generated by `@snaplet/seed` will start off the sequences where the existing data left off.

For example, if you have a table with a `SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`, and there are 10 rows in a table already (so you already have primary keys from `1` to `10`),
`@snaplet/seed` will start generating primary keys from `11` onwards.

### Model callback API

We are introducing a new way of definining models when you need contextual data. It impacts both parents and children fields.

#### Children fields

You can now define children fields as a callback function that receives the model's seed and the index of the current iteration:

```ts
await seed.posts([
  // model level seed
  ({ index, seed }) => ({
    title: `Post #${index}`,
    content: `This post's seed is ${seed}`
  }),
  // static data is of course still supported
  {
    title: 'Static post',
    // field level seed
    content: ({ seed }) => copycat.paragraph(seed)
  },
]);
```

This change is also reflected into the `x` helper function which now supports static data as well:

```ts
await seed.posts(x => x(3, (ctx) => ({
  title: `Post #${ctx.index}`,
  content: `This post's seed is ${ctx.seed}`
})));

await seed.posts(x => x(3, {
  title: 'Static post',
  content: (ctx) => copycat.paragraph(ctx.seed)
}));
```

#### Parent fields

You can now define parent fields as a callback function that receives the model's seed and a `connect` function. It finally makes connecting data more explicit:

```ts
await seed.posts([
  {
    // the author will be connected to the first user in the store
    author: (ctx) => ctx.connect(({ store }) => store.users[0])
  },
  {
    // a new author will be generated
    author: (ctx) => {
      const createdAt = new Date(copycat.dateString(ctx.seed))
      const day = 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24
      const updatedAt = new Date(createdAt.getTime() + day)
      return {
        createdAt,
        updatedAt,
      }
    }
  },
])
```

### Fix the `seed` value for parent fields

We were injecting the model's seed for all parent fields in a model. We're now injected a per parent field seed to have more variety in connected data.
As the seed value changed, it means that you might experience different models being picked up when using `connect`.

### Inflection is now turned on by default

You no longer need a `seed.config.ts` file to enable inflection. It's now turned on by default.
We think inflection brings a better developer experience and we want to make it the default.

If you want to disable it, you can pass `false` to the `inflection` option in your `seed.config.ts` file:

```ts seed.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';

export default defineConfig({
  seed: {
    alias: {
      inflection: false,
    },
  },
});
```

Don't forget to regenerate your types and assets after updating your config by running:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx snaplet generate
```

## From `0.83.0` and above
We've removed the `modelSeed` parameter that we pass to generate functions in favor of a new `data` parameter.

Previously, if you had a field with a value that depended on another field, `modelSeed` provided a way to accomplish this:

```
// **before**
await snaplet.users([{
  createdAt: ({ modelSeed }) => copycat.dateString(modelSeed),
  updateAt: ({ modelSeed }) => {
    const createdAt = copycat.dateString(modelSeed)
    const updatedAtMs = Number(new Date(createdAt)) + 60_000
    return new Date(updatedAtMs).toISOString()
  }
}]
```

Since we now have the `data` parameter, we have a more natural way of obtaining the value generated for previous values:

```
// **after**
await snaplet.users([{
  createdAt: ({ seed }) => copycat.dateString(seed),
  updateAt: ({ data }) => {
    const updatedAtMs = Number(new Date(data.createdAt)) + 60_000
    return new Date(updatedAtMs).toISOString()
  }
}]
```

## From `0.81.0` and above

### Stateful data client

The `SnapletClient` is now stateful.

It means that a global seed is now incremented every time you call a model function on the data client.

```ts seed.ts
// calling a model multiple times works and will continue the id sequences
await snaplet.users([{}]);
await snaplet.users([{}]);
```

All the generated data is now centralized into a global store available as the `$store` property on the data client.

```ts seed.ts
await snaplet.users([{}]);

// { users: [ { id: 1, email: 'john.doe@acme.com' } ] }
console.log(snaplet.$store);
```

You can reset the state of the data client by calling the `$reset` function.

```ts seed.ts
await snaplet.users([{}]);
snaplet.$reset();
```

And you can get a new instance of the data client by calling the `$transaction` function.
It receives a data client which state is reset.
It's particularly useful in tests when you want a new client for each test.

```ts seed.ts
await snaplet.$transaction(async (snaplet) => {
  await snaplet.users([{}]);
});
```

### Store as a first-class citizen

Everytime you call a model function, it now returns the generated data as a store.

```ts seed.ts
const singleUserStore = await snaplet.users([{}]);
const usersStore = await snaplet.users(x => x(3));

// { users: [ { id: 1 } ] }
console.log(singleUserStore);

// { users: [ { id: 2 }, { id: 3 }, { id: 4 } ] }
console.log(usersStore);

// { users: [ { id: 1 }, { id: 2 }, { id: 3 }, { id: 4 } ] }
console.log(snaplet.$store);
```

### Fine-grained connections

`autoConnect` is renamed to `connect` and now accepts either `true` or a store.
It allows for more flexibility when you want to connect generated data to existing data.

```ts seed.ts
await snaplet.users(x => x(3));

// it will connect the authors of the posts to the previously generated users
await snaplet.posts(x => x(3), { connect: true });
```

`connect: true` is a shorthand for `connect: snaplet.$store`.

And here is how you can pass a custom store.

```ts seed.ts
// it will connect the authors of the posts to one of these users
const externalStore = { users: [{ id: 42 }, { id: 5432 }]} };
await snaplet.posts(x => x(3), { connect: externalStore });
```

### Good bye operators!

We are removing the `pipe` and `merge` operators in light of the previous changes.

If previously you had something like this:

```ts seed.ts
await snaplet.$pipe([
  snaplet.users(x => x(3)),
  snaplet.posts(x => x(3), { autoConnect: true }),
]);
```

It is now equivalent to:

```ts seed.ts
await snaplet.users(x => x(3));
await snaplet.posts(x => x(3), { connect: true });
```

Or if you don't want to connect on the global store:

```ts seed.ts
const usersStore = await snaplet.users(x => x(3));
await snaplet.posts(x => x(3), { connect: usersStore });
```

## From `0.76.0` and above

In this version, we are removing the `run` function from the `generate` configuration.

Instead, we're introducing a new package called `@snaplet/seed`.

We extracted the data client into its own package so you can use it everywhere in your codebase!

Seed scripts or tests, data are now one import away! Let's see how to migrate to it.

First, install the new package:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npm install -D @snaplet/seed
```

Like the [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client), this package is in fact a proxy to the local data client you will generate with Snaplet CLI based on your database schema.

In order to do that, we repurposed the command `snaplet generate` to generate the data client! You can now run it.

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx snaplet generate
```

It will create a folder containing your data client source code under `node_modules/.snaplet`. This package is then re-exported by `@snaplet/seed`.

Now, let's edit your `seed.config.ts` and port your `run` function to a seed script.

<CH.Scrollycoding>

Given this configuration.

```ts seed.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';

export default defineConfig({
  generate: {
    alias: {
      inflection: true,
    },
    async run(snaplet) {
      await snaplet.users((x) => x(3, () => ({
        posts: (x) => x(10),
      }))),
    },
  },
});
```

---

* Copy the content of your `run` function and remove it.
* Rename the `generate` key in your config to `seed`:

```ts seed.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';

export default defineConfig({
  seed: {
    alias: {
      inflection: true,
    },
  },
});
```

---

Create a new `seed.ts` file and import the Snaplet data client.

```ts seed.ts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';
```

---

Create a new `snaplet` client instance.

If you were relying on snaplet to clear any existing data from your database first, you now do this explicitly with `snaplet.$resetDatabase()`.

```ts seed.ts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient();

snaplet.$resetDatabase();
```

---

Paste what you copied earlier from your `run` function.

```ts seed.ts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient();

snaplet.$resetDatabase();

await snaplet.users((x) => x(3, () => ({
  posts: (x) => x(10),
})));
```
</CH.Scrollycoding>

The `snaplet` data client is automatically connected to your target database defined in either your `.snaplet/config.json` file or your `SNAPLET_TARGET_DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

You can now run your seed script with any TypeScript runner like [`tsx`](https://github.com/privatenumber/tsx) or [`ts-node`](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/).

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
npx tsx seed.ts
```

If you were relying on the `--sql` option to generate a SQL file instead of having the data client writing directly to your database, you can now use the `dryRun` option in the data client.

```ts seed.ts
import { SnapletClient } from '@snaplet/seed';

const snaplet = new SnapletClient({ dryRun: true });

// With the dryRun option, the data client will output all the SQL queries to stdout.
await snaplet.users((x) => x(3, () => ({
  posts: (x) => x(10),
})));
```

To know more about the data client, check out the [documentation](/seed/getting-started/quick-start).

## From `0.66.0` and above

The `generate` API is evolving! After a great number of feedbacks from the community during the alpha, we decided to make it more flexible and powerful.

The new API is still in beta, but we encourage you to try it out and give us feedbacks.

Here is a step-by-step guide to migrate your existing `generate` plan to the new API.

You can start by regenerating your types by running:

```bash >_&nbsp;terminal
snaplet config generate
```

Now, let's edit your `seed.config.ts` file.

<CH.Scrollycoding>

This is what we had before version `0.66.0`.

```ts seed.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';

export default defineConfig({
  generate: {
    plan({ snaplet }) {
      return snaplet.User({
        count: 3,
        data: {
          email: ({ seed }) =>
            copycat.email(seed),
          Post: {
            count: 10,
          }
        }
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

---

Rename `plan` to `run`, and make it async. You are no longer required to return a plan. Calling `await` on a plan will automatically run it.

```ts seed.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';

export default defineConfig({
  generate: {
    // focus(1,2[7:12])
    async run({ snaplet }) {
      await snaplet.User({
        count: 3,
        data: {
          email: ({ seed }) =>
            copycat.email(seed),
          Post: {
            count: 10,
          }
        }
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

---

We inject directly the `snaplet` data client in the `run` function.

The utilities and operators are now available directly on the `snaplet` object: `snaplet.$pipe`, `snaplet.$merge` and `snaplet.$createStore`.

```ts seed.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';

export default defineConfig({
  generate: {
    // focus
    async run(snaplet) {
      await snaplet.User({
        count: 3,
        data: {
          email: ({ seed }) =>
            copycat.email(seed),
          Post: {
            count: 10,
          }
        }
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

---

We no longer need `count` and `data`, you can pass the values directly.

```ts seed.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';

export default defineConfig({
  generate: {
    async run(snaplet) {
      // focus(1:5)
      await snaplet.User({
          email: ({ seed }) =>
            copycat.email(seed),
        Post: {}
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

---

To create lists of data, you can either pass an array or use our `x` helper function passed in a callback.

```ts seed.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';

export default defineConfig({
  generate: {
    async run(snaplet) {
      // focus(1:5)
      await snaplet.User((x) => x(3, () => ({
        email: ({ seed }) =>
          copycat.email(seed),
        Post: (x) => x(10),
      }))),
    },
  },
});
```

---

Congrats, you are now using the new API!

```ts seed.config.ts
/// <reference path=".snaplet/snaplet.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'snaplet';

export default defineConfig({
  generate: {
    async run(snaplet) {
      await snaplet.User((x) => x(3, () => ({
        email: ({ seed }) =>
          copycat.email(seed),
        Post: (x) => x(10),
      }))),
    },
  },
});
```
